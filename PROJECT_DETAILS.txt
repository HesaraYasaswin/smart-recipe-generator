5. PROBLEMS FACED AND SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

MAJOR CHALLENGE 1: FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED Error
PROBLEM: Vercel serverless function was failing to start, returning 500 errors
ROOT CAUSE: Incorrect function syntax and module import issues
SOLUTION: 
- Switched from CommonJS (module.exports) to ES modules (export default)
- Removed problematic node-fetch import and used native fetch
- Simplified function structure and added comprehensive error handling
- Used Cursor AI to debug and iterate through multiple solutions

MAJOR CHALLENGE 2: Environment Variable Configuration
PROBLEM: OpenAI API key not being recognized in production
ROOT CAUSE: Environment variables not properly set in Vercel dashboard
SOLUTION:
- Added comprehensive logging to identify the issue
- Created step-by-step deployment guide for environment setup
- Implemented proper error handling for missing API keys
- Used Cursor AI to generate troubleshooting documentation

SOLUTION:
- Added comprehensive CORS headers to API function
- Implemented proper preflight request handling
- Used dynamic URL detection for development vs production
- Added error handling for network issues

MAJOR CHALLENGE 4: Recipe Parsing and Formatting
PROBLEM: AI-generated recipes not parsing correctly into structured data
ROOT CAUSE: Inconsistent AI response format and complex text parsing
SOLUTION:
- Implemented robust regex-based parsing with fallbacks
- Added multiple parsing strategies for different response formats
- Created comprehensive error handling for malformed responses
- Used Cursor AI to optimize parsing logic and handle edge cases
